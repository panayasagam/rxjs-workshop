## Scaffolding exercises
- Think of the goal of the exercise
- Create a TypeScript file for the exercise. It will have instructions, basic layed out code with no implementation, and a default export which will be used as an entrypoint for the exercise
- The main app component should have a display for all exercises and allow activating one of them.
- Activating an exercise means using the default export of the exercise as the observable the app will subscribe to
- If an exercise requires data or any other simulation (e.g. http request, localstorage, etc), make those global to the app so all exercises have access to them
- Scaffold exercises without the answers. Only a placeholder
- Placeholders should compile so the app can run

## Location
Put exercises in the `./src/app/exercises` folder. Files should have a numeric prefix (01, 02, ...) and a description. For example:
`01 - Observable creation.ts`
`02 - Mapping an filtering.ts`

## Running commands
Never use `npm run` commands
Always use `npx nx` commands
Never install packages globally
Never try to run packages from the global scope
