## RxJS & Reactivity Angular Workshop

This repository contains hands-on exercises focused on RxJS and reactivity in Angular, designed to progress from beginner to more advanced concepts. Each exercise is organized in its own folder and includes placeholder (dummy) implementations for students to complete.

### How it works

- **Placeholder Implementations:** Exercises are scaffolded with incomplete code. Students are expected to replace the dummy implementations with their own solutions.
- **Reusable Code:** Common logic and repeated patterns are abstracted into services, folders, or utilities to avoid duplication and encourage best practices.
- **Interactive App:** The Angular application provides a UI for selecting and working on any of the exercises.
- **Ready for StackBlitz:** The project is structured to compile and run even with placeholder code, making it easy to use in online editors like StackBlitz.

> **Note:** Exercises are actual Angular code files, not just string-based instructions. Students will work directly in the codebase to complete each task.
